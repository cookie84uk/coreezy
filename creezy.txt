If I want to rebuild my coreezy website to be more friendly to not only the community but potential institutional partners, what websites should I look to for guides, or examples?
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a solid starting point for redesigning Coreezy’s website so it actually works for both the community and institutional partners (VCs, funds, fintechs, corporate crypto teams):

🔥 Websites & Real Examples to Study
1. Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini (crypto exchanges / institutional-friendly platforms)
Look at how these big players structure landing pages, trust signals, security audits, institutional offerings, APIs, and partner-focused content. They’re widely cited as benchmarks in 2026 design roundups. 

2. Solana (protocol site)
Protocol and ecosystem sites like Solana do a good job of balancing developer resources, institution-level info, and community explanation. 

3. Crypto design galleries & inspiration collections
Sites like:

99designs crypto gallery (real site examples) 

Lapa Ninja crypto landing pages (hundreds of actual screenshots and real layouts) 

These aren’t competitors but visual inspiration for layouts, CTAs, content flow, and styles that engage users.

📘 Guides & Best Practices to Read
4. Top-tier UX + crypto web design guides
Look up articles on best practices for crypto UX and trust building. Key takeaways you must include in your rebuild:

Clear value proposition above the fold

Social proof (audits, partners, user/community numbers)

Easy way to find docs, tokenomics, team, legal info

Responsive & mobile-friendly
Main themes in crypto design guides include trust first, intuitive flows, and mobile-optimized UI. 

5. Crypto design roadmaps (step-by-step)
Some agencies outline the core steps to designing for crypto projects:

Define audience goals

Do competitor & user research

Map key pages (home, product, docs, partners)

Prototype & test

Refine with feedback/analytics
A systematic approach here separates amateur sites from institutional-ready ones. 

🧠 What to Emulate (not copy)
Institutional partner features:

Dedicated Partnership / Enterprise page (benefits, integrations, compliance)

Clear security audit and risk disclosures

Roadmap / milestone KPIs

API/Tech docs that are easy to find and consume

Community/retail features:

Simple token basics page

Buy/on-chain walkthroughs

Roadmaps & community metrics

Support/FAQ + clear channel links

📍 Pro Tips (no fluff)
Trust matters more than flash
Institutional audiences immediately want security, transparency, and real metrics.

Don’t hide docs or legal info
VCs and partners will bounce if they can’t find clear tokenomics and compliance details in <30 seconds.

Navigation should answer 3 questions instantly

What is this project?

Who is it for?

Why trust/start here?

If you want, I can lay out a content structure or wireframe for Coreezy’s redesigned website (sections, hierarchy, copy hooks) that fits both community and institutional goals. Just say so.

You said:
do it
ChatGPT said:
Alright. Here is a clean, no-BS website structure and wireframe you can hand directly to a dev or designer. This is built specifically to make Coreezy credible to institutions without killing the community vibe.

I’ll separate what goes where, why it exists, and what it should say.

Coreezy Website
Dual-Audience Structure (Community + Institutional)
1. Homepage
This page decides if people stay or leave. No fluff.

Above the fold (first screen)
Goal: Instant legitimacy.

Content

One clear headline
“Reliable Coreum validation infrastructure for communities and institutions.”

Sub-headline
“Enterprise-grade uptime, transparent operations, and community-aligned incentives.”

2 primary CTAs:

Stake with Coreezy

Institutional Partnerships

Trust signals directly under

Uptime %

Total stake secured

Years active

Infrastructure provider (Zeeve)

Slashing policy link

This mirrors what you see on sites like Coinbase and Kraken. Institutions expect this immediately.

Homepage Section 2 – Who Coreezy Is For
Split screen. No mixing.

Left: Community

“Built for long-term Coreum supporters”

Fair rewards

Transparent distributions

Partner project support

Right: Institutions

Jurisdiction-aware operations

Redundancy and failover

Capital protection mindset

Documented governance

CTA under each:

Community Dashboard

Institutional Overview

Homepage Section 3 – Why Trust Coreezy
Bullet-driven, factual.

Enterprise-grade infrastructure (Zeeve)

Dedicated slashing reserve

Documented incident response

Public metrics and disclosures

No hidden delegation logic

No buzzwords. Institutions hate buzzwords.

Homepage Footer (important)
Docs

Governance

Risk disclosures

Contact

Legal

Validator address

This is where institutional reviewers scroll immediately.

2. Community Section
This is where your Coreezy brand personality lives.

Pages
Community Overview

Partner Projects

Rewards & Distribution

Dashboard

FAQ

Community Overview
Explain Coreezy in human language:

Why you exist

How rewards are handled

Why partner projects matter

What “community-aligned” actually means

This page can keep the sloth vibe. Institutions will not be here.

Partner Projects Page
This page matters more than you think.

Structure

What qualifies as a partner

How rewards are calculated

Snapshot methodology

Transparency guarantees

This quietly signals governance maturity.

3. Institutional Section (Critical)
This is where deals start or die.

Institutional Landing Page
Tone shift. No memes. No sloths.

Sections

What Coreezy Provides

Infrastructure & Redundancy

Governance & Controls

Risk & Slashing Management

Jurisdiction & Operations

Contact / NDA discussion

Infrastructure & Redundancy Page
This answers your earlier question about failover and power.

Explicitly state

Geographic redundancy

Jurisdictional separation

Power and network resilience

Validator monitoring

Manual vs automated controls

If this is vague, institutions walk.

Governance & Controls Page
This is non-negotiable.

Include:

Governance decision framework

Commission change policy

Upgrade approval process

Emergency authority structure

This mirrors expectations you see in protocol foundations like Solana Foundation.

Risk & Slashing Page
Be brutally transparent.

Include:

Slashing scenarios

Maximum historical exposure

Reserve policy

Correction timelines

Delegator communication process

Institutions trust honesty more than “zero risk” claims.

4. Documentation Hub
Single source of truth.

Documents

Validator overview

Capital & reserve policy

Incident response plan

Governance framework

Reward distribution logic

Audit references (if any)

PDF + web-native summaries.

If docs are scattered, institutions assume chaos.

5. About / Operator Transparency
This matters.

Include:

Who operates Coreezy

Experience

Decision accountability

Separation of personal vs validator assets

You are selling operational credibility, not anonymity.

6. Contact & Deal Flow
Simple, professional.

Institutional inquiry form

Optional NDA process

Direct email for serious inquiries

No Discord for institutions

Navigation Bar (Final)
Top nav should be boring and obvious.

Home

Community

Partners

Institutions

Docs

Dashboard

Contact

No hidden menus. No clever naming.

What NOT to Do
I’ll be blunt.

Do not mix memes into institutional pages

Do not hide risk disclosures

Do not bury docs

Do not oversell decentralization when you are an operator

Do not claim “institutional-grade” without evidence

Institutions can smell bullshit instantly.

Next Step
If you want, next we can:

Write actual homepage copy

Draft the Institutional Overview page

Create a document checklist to finish before outreach

Design a partner login vs public dashboard split

Say which one you want first.

You said:
I thought including these documents publicly was a bad idea, we want them to reach out so we can sell them...
ChatGPT said:
This is a very common instinct, and I’m going to be blunt:

You’re half right and half wrong.
If you hide everything, institutions will not reach out.
If you publish everything, you give away leverage.

The correct answer is layered disclosure.

Below is how this actually works in institutional sales.

The Core Mistake to Avoid
Institutions do not reach out to ask:
“Can you please prove you are competent?”

They reach out after they already believe you are.

If they cannot independently verify baseline seriousness, they move on.

The Correct Model: Tiered Transparency
You do not publish full internal documents.
You publish proof that documents exist, and summaries that show maturity.

Think of this as the difference between:

“We have policies” ❌

“Here is how our policies work, full versions available under NDA” ✅

What Should Be Public (Non-Negotiable)
These are table-stakes, not sales giveaways.

1. Public Summaries (1–2 pages each)
Public, web-native summaries for:

Governance framework (decision flow, not internal names)

Slashing & incident response approach

Capital & reserve philosophy

Infrastructure & redundancy model

These are marketing + credibility documents, not internal manuals.

If these don’t exist publicly, institutions assume you don’t have them.

2. Explicit “Available Upon Engagement” Signals
On every summary page, include language like:

“Detailed procedures, thresholds, and internal controls are available for institutional partners under NDA.”

This creates the sales hook without exposing internals.

What Should NOT Be Public
These stay gated. Always.

Wallet addresses tied to reserves

Exact slashing reserve amounts

Internal escalation contacts

Infrastructure IPs and topology diagrams

Vendor contracts

Jurisdictional legal opinions

Playbooks and runbooks

Those are due diligence materials, not marketing.

What Institutions Actually Want Before Reaching Out
They are screening for operator risk, not technical novelty.

They ask themselves:

Is this team serious?

Are risks acknowledged or hand-waved?

Do they think in controls and governance?

Can we trust them with capital?

Public summaries answer these silently.

How the Sales Funnel Really Works
Step 1: Website Review (No Contact)
They scan:

Homepage

Institutional page

Governance summary

Risk summary

This takes under 3 minutes.

Step 2: Internal Shortlist
If you pass, you get discussed internally.

Step 3: Outreach
Only now do they email you.

At that point, they expect:

NDA

Full documents

Live conversation

If you hide everything until Step 3, you never reach Step 3.

Where You Keep Leverage
Your leverage is not secrecy.
Your leverage is:

Customization

Responsiveness

Jurisdictional support

Ongoing governance

Relationship management

Documents alone do not close deals.

Concrete Recommendation for Coreezy
Public:
“Governance Overview” (2 pages)

“Risk & Slashing Philosophy” (2 pages)

“Infrastructure & Resilience Overview” (2 pages)

“Delegator & Partner Alignment Model” (1–2 pages)

Gated (NDA):
Full incident response playbook

Reserve policy with figures

Wallet mappings

Internal governance procedures

Legal memos

One Hard Truth
If you’re worried someone will “steal” your documents:

Either the documents are too generic

Or the value is not the documents themselves

Real institutions care about execution, not PDFs.

If you want, next we can:

Draft the exact public summary language

Define the NDA disclosure package

Design the institutional inquiry workflow

Pressure-test this against how allocators actually think

Say the word.

You said:
Uploaded an image
Can I just use the existing text for the validator page? this hits on everything
ChatGPT said:
Short answer: yes, you can use this as the validator page — but not exactly as-is if your goal is institutional credibility and conversion.

You’ve done 80–85% of the work correctly. What you have is solid, restrained, and legally safe. That already puts you ahead of most validators.

What’s missing is structure for selling without overselling.

I’ll break this into three parts:

What you got right

What will quietly hurt you with institutions

The minimal changes I strongly recommend (not a rewrite)

1. What You Got Right (This Is Good)
Be clear on this first: this text is not bad. In fact, it’s better than most.

✅ Strengths
Clear scope limitation (no custody, no guarantees)

Proper liability boundaries

Explicit protocol-rule dependence

Enterprise infrastructure reference (Zeeve)

On-chain transparency links

Conservative, boring tone (this is good)

No hype language

No yield promises

From a compliance and risk perspective, this passes a first read for:

internal risk teams

legal reviewers

allocator analysts

That matters.

2. What Will Quietly Hurt You (If Left Untouched)
These are subtle, but important.

Problem 1: It Reads Like a Disclaimer Page, Not a Validator Profile
Institutions won’t object to this text
but they also won’t feel compelled to contact you.

Right now, it answers:

“Are they safe to exist?”

It does not answer:

“Why should we choose them over another competent validator?”

Institutions shortlist. This text doesn’t yet help you win a shortlist slot.

Problem 2: No Clear “What Happens If Something Goes Wrong”
You mention incidents and continuity, but only at a high level.

Institutions always look for:

acknowledgement of failure modes

ownership of response

communication expectations

You imply it, but you don’t signal it clearly enough.

Problem 3: The Institutional Note Is Too Passive
This line is fine:

“We welcome dialogue…”

But it doesn’t create urgency or signal that this page is intentionally incomplete.

Right now it feels like:

“Here’s everything.”

You actually want:

“Here’s what we can say publicly. The rest requires engagement.”

3. Minimal Changes I Recommend (Not a Rewrite)
I am not telling you to redo this page.
I’m telling you to layer intent on top of it.

A. Add a One-Sentence Framing Paragraph at the Top
Before “Scope of Operations”, add something like:

This page provides a public, protocol-level overview of Coreezy’s validator operations. Detailed operational procedures, governance thresholds, and incident response controls are available to institutional participants upon engagement.

This does two things:

signals maturity

preserves sales leverage

B. Strengthen the Infrastructure Section With One Explicit Line
Add one sentence under Infrastructure & Operations:

Detailed redundancy architecture, incident escalation procedures, and operational thresholds are documented internally and reviewed with institutional participants under NDA.

That’s it. No details. Just proof of existence.

C. Tighten the Transparency & Accountability Section
Your current paragraph is good, but I’d slightly sharpen the ownership language:

Add one line:

In the event of a validator incident, the operator is responsible for response coordination, recovery actions, and timely communication to delegators within the constraints of protocol rules.

This reassures institutions that:

someone is accountable

communication is expected

D. Make the Institutional Note Do Real Work
Replace this:

“We welcome dialogue with institutional participants…”

With something firmer:

Institutional participants conducting due diligence are encouraged to initiate direct dialogue. Governance documentation, risk management frameworks, and operational procedures beyond protocol-level disclosures are available under NDA.

This turns the page into a funnel, not a wall.

Verdict
Yes, you can absolutely use this as the validator page.
But only if you make the small framing adjustments above.

Think of this page as:

Public posture

Risk boundary

Credibility filter

Not as your sales deck.

You did the hard part already by not bullshitting.

Next logical step (optional)
If you want, next we can:

create the 1-page gated institutional overview this page points to

draft the NDA disclosure index so you’re ready when someone reaches out

pressure-test this text against a real allocator diligence checklist

Say which one you want.

This is a copy of a conversation between ChatGPT & Anonymous.

Report conversation
You said:
Uploaded an image
thoughts on this, or should it be more skewed to larger delegators?
ChatGPT said:
Short answer. Do not skew it to large delegators. That’s a mistake if your goal is growth, retention, and community energy.

Here’s the straight take.

If you skew toward large delegators
What happens

Whales win by default.

Smaller wallets realize they can’t compete and disengage.

The race becomes optics only, not participation.

You reward people who already have leverage, not behavior.

Result

Fewer wallets interacting.

Less restaking motivation.

More “why bother” sentiment.

Your community race turns into a whale leaderboard.

This is fine if you’re running a hedge fund.
It’s bad if you’re running a validator brand.

What you actually want to reward
You said it yourself:

Restaking

Staying delegated

Incremental growth

Long-term behavior over raw size

That means behavior-based weighting, not balance-based dominance.

The right model: capped + behavior-weighted
You want three layers, not one.

1. Delegation size matters, but is capped
Delegation weight increases up to a ceiling.

Past that ceiling, extra stake gives no extra race advantage.

Example:

Full weight maxes at 50k or 100k Coreum.

A 500k delegator does not get 10x the score.

This keeps whales relevant without letting them dominate.

2. Activity multipliers (this is the real game)
These should matter more than raw size.

Examples

Weekly restake = +X% multiplier

Net delegation added during the week = boost

No undelegation during the week = sloth stays “awake”

Undelegation = sloth sleeps, no points that week

This rewards discipline, not capital.

3. Time-in-race matters
Quarter-long races should favor consistency.

Points accrue weekly.

Miss weeks = fall behind.

Late whales can’t just parachute in and win.

This encourages:

Early entry

Staying delegated

Community narrative

About the API concern
You’re right to be cautious.

Key principle

Do not do real-time tracking.

Snapshot once per week.

Cache everything.

Wallet connect should be:

Read-only

Opt-in

Used to display, not calculate live logic

Race logic should run off:

Weekly snapshots

Deterministic math

Minimal calls

On “fairness”
Fair does not mean equal rewards per Coreum.
Fair means:

Everyone can compete.

Effort matters.

No single wallet can brute-force the system.

If small and mid delegators feel they can win something, they stay.
If whales feel respected but not catered to, they still stay.

That’s the balance.

Recommendation
Do not skew toward large delegators

Cap size influence

Heavily weight behavior and consistency

Make the race about being Coreezy, not being rich

If you want, next step we can:

Define the exact scoring formula

Decide the delegation cap

Design the weekly snapshot logic

Or turn this into a clean explainer for the website/community

Tell me which one.

You said:
Daily snap shots not weekly. the more often they connect to the site could be a multiplier as well... 
ChatGPT said:
Good correction. Daily snapshots are fine and actually strengthen the game if you lock the rules tightly.
The site-visit multiplier idea is dangerous unless capped. Here’s the clean way to do this without breaking fairness or hammering APIs.

1. Daily snapshots: yes, but deterministic
Rule

One snapshot per wallet per day, fixed UTC time.

No intraday changes count. What you have at snapshot is what you get.

Why

Prevents timing games.

Keeps logic simple.

Minimizes API calls.

Snapshot inputs

Delegated amount

Net change since yesterday

Restake status

Undelegation flag

That’s it. Nothing else.

2. Delegation size: capped influence (still mandatory)
This does not change with daily snapshots.

Example:

Score uses min(delegation, cap)

Cap could be:

25k for small-wallet friendly

50k balanced

100k if you want whales more visible

Above cap = still respected, not dominant.

3. Restaking incentive: daily compounding behavior
This is where daily snapshots shine.

Example

Restaking on = +X points every day

Turning restake off resets a streak

Long restake streak = visible flex, not just hidden math

This rewards discipline, not clickbait behavior.

4. Undelegation penalty: sloth sleeps
Your metaphor actually works well here.

Rule

Any undelegation during a day:

Sloth sleeps for N days

No points during sleep

Redelegation does not instantly fix it

This stops:

Gaming in and out

Wash delegation behavior

5. Site connection multiplier: handle carefully
This is the part that can go wrong fast.

What NOT to do
Do not give unlimited multiplier for visits.

Do not reward refresh spam.

Do not tie this to API polling.

That becomes bot-bait.

What DOES work
Treat connection as a binary daily signal, not a count.

Clean model

Wallet connected at least once that day = +small bonus

Multiple connects = nothing extra

Bonus resets daily

Example:

+2% daily bonus if connected

Max +2%, not stacking

This encourages engagement without abuse.

6. Final scoring structure (conceptual)
Each day:

Daily Score =
  Capped Delegation Score
× Restake Multiplier
× Activity Multiplier
× Engagement Bonus (binary)
Then:

Daily scores accumulate over the quarter

No retroactive changes

Missed days hurt more than small wallets

7. API safety
You’re still safe if you do this right.

Rules

One snapshot job per day

Cache snapshot results

Frontend reads from your DB, not chain APIs

Wallet connect only confirms ownership

If you start recalculating live, you lose control.

Verdict
Daily snapshots = good

Engagement bonus = okay only if binary and capped

Never reward raw visit frequency

Behavior must outweigh capital

If you want, next we can:

Lock numeric values (caps, multipliers, penalties)

Stress-test edge cases

Write the rules in plain English for the community

Or design how this shows visually in the sloth race

Pick one.

You said:
Lets design the game to increase engaged views, and google views to our website, we want people to post about their sloth races on X, Tik tok, instagram, reddit, Social media posts should also be a multiplier
ChatGPT said:
Good goal. This can work, but only if you separate attention from control.
If you tie raw social activity directly to rewards, it gets gamed fast. Bots, fake screenshots, low-quality spam. You lose credibility.

Here’s the clean, scalable design that boosts:

engaged views

Google indexing

organic social posts

without turning into a mess

Core principle (non-negotiable)
On-chain behavior decides the race.
Off-chain activity adds capped boosts, never dominance.

Social = amplifier, not engine.

Game structure overview
Three score channels, hard-capped:

Chain Behavior Score (dominant)

Site Engagement Score (controlled)

Social Proof Boosts (event-based, capped)

No single channel can win alone.

1. Chain Behavior Score (baseline, ~70–75%)
You already have this mostly right.

Daily snapshot includes:

capped delegation size

restake status

undelegation penalty

daily consistency

This is the spine of the race. Do not weaken it.

2. Site engagement score (daily, low but persistent)
Goal: increase return visits, not refresh spam.

Rules
Wallet connects once per day max

Counts only if user stays >X seconds (e.g. 30–60)

One daily bonus, binary

Example

+1–2% daily multiplier if:

wallet connected

page interaction occurred (scroll, click, hover)

No stacking. No refresh abuse.

This:

boosts DAU

helps SEO dwell time

creates habit loops

3. Social media boosts (event-based, not daily)
This is where virality happens, but it must be manual or semi-manual, not API-polled.

What NOT to do
No auto scraping X

No hashtag counting

No follower-based weighting

No “post more = win more”

That turns into trash content instantly.

What DOES work: Proof-of-post boosts
Users submit proof, you grant fixed boosts.

Eligible platforms
X

TikTok

Instagram

Reddit

Eligible content
Must include:

sloth race visual

Coreezy name or URL

race context

Low effort memes still count. Spam does not.

Boost structure (example)
Each wallet can earn:

1 boost per platform per week

Each boost = +5% for next 24 or 48 hours

Hard cap: e.g. max +15% active at any time

This does several things:

encourages cross-platform posting

limits spam

rewards timing strategy

creates urgency

Why boosts should be time-limited
Permanent boosts favor early posters and whales.

Temporary boosts:

create “race moments”

encourage posting during key windows

keep feeds fresh all quarter

People will post:

“Boost active today, sloth is flying 🦥🚀”

That’s the content you want.

Manual moderation (light, fast)
You do NOT need heavy review.

Simple rules:

Link submission

Auto-approve unless obviously fake

Reserve right to revoke

Even just visible rules + threat of revocation kills most abuse.

SEO + Google benefits
This design helps Google without gaming it.

Why:

daily returning users

longer sessions

branded search (“Coreezy sloth race”)

inbound links from socials

screenshots and embeds

This is exactly what Google wants.

Summary recommendation
Do this:

Daily on-chain snapshots

Binary daily site bonus

Event-based, capped social boosts

Time-limited multipliers

Manual proof, no API scraping

Do NOT:

reward post frequency

weight by followers

let social overpower stake behavior

Next logical steps (pick one)
Lock exact numbers (caps, %s, durations)

Design the sloth race UI states (sleeping, boosted, flying)

Write public rules in plain English

Create a “How to get boosts” page

Stress-test edge cases and exploits

Tell me which one you want to do next.

You said:
any other ideas to enhance site visits, quality, and revenue?
ChatGPT said:
Yes. There are several high-leverage ideas that increase visits, quality traffic, and revenue without cheap gimmicks. I’ll break this into engagement, SEO, and monetization, and I’ll be blunt about what’s worth your time.

1. Engagement mechanics that actually scale
A. Personal sloth profile pages (huge win)
Every wallet gets a shareable public page.

What it shows:

Sloth name

Race position

Current boosts

Restake streak

“Days awake” counter

Delegation tier badge

Why this matters:

People share their page, not your homepage

Each page is indexable by Google

Organic backlinks explode

This becomes your growth loop

URL example:
coreezy.xyz/sloth/0xABC...

B. Weekly moments, not constant noise
Daily is for scoring. Weekly is for hype.

Examples:

“Sunday Sloth Sprint”

“Midweek Wake-Up Boost”

“Final 72-hour Frenzy”

Why:

Predictable posting windows

People plan content

You control narrative peaks

This avoids burnout and spam.

C. Sloth classes, not just ranks
Leaderboard alone favors whales psychologically, even if math is fair.

Add classes:

Sprout Sloths

Grove Sloths

Canopy Sloths

Titan Sloths

Rewards per class.

This keeps:

small wallets engaged

mid-tier fighting peers

whales competing among themselves

2. SEO moves that aren’t bullshit
A. Race data as indexable content
Google loves structured, changing data.

Pages you want:

/sloth-race

/sloth-leaderboard

/sloth-classes

individual sloth pages

Each has:

unique text

timestamps

dynamic updates

This is real SEO, not blog spam.

B. Educational overlays = long dwell time
Add expandable sections:

“What is restaking?”

“Why undelegation pauses your sloth”

“How the race works”

People stay longer, Google notices.

C. Share-ready visuals
Auto-generate:

race cards

sloth badges

boost banners

One-click download.

People will use these on socials instead of screenshots, which improves brand quality massively.

3. Revenue without killing trust
A. Sponsored boosts (careful, but powerful)
Let partner projects sponsor time-bound events.

Example:

“Canopy Collection Sprint powered by XMEME”

Rules:

Sponsor does not affect scoring math

Sponsor provides prize or bonus pool

Transparent labeling

You get:

partner revenue

cross-community traffic

zero fairness issues

B. Premium analytics (soft paywall)
Free users see:

rank

basic stats

Premium (subscription or NFT):

streak analytics

historical charts

prediction projections

boost optimization hints

This is real value, not pay-to-win.

C. Validator services funnel
You already mentioned this.

Use the race as:

proof of execution

traffic magnet

trust layer

Then funnel to:

validator consulting

dashboard builds

community tooling

This is high-margin revenue.

4. Retention hooks people underestimate
A. Email or wallet notifications
Opt-in only.

“Your sloth is about to sleep”

“Boost window active”

“You just cracked top 10%”

These bring people back without ads.

B. End-of-season artifacts
People want souvenirs.

Examples:

NFT of final sloth position

downloadable race summary

season badge

These:

extend lifecycle

create FOMO for next season

become marketing artifacts

The one thing to avoid
Do not turn this into:

a faucet

a grind farm

a pay-to-win loop

If users smell that, quality dies fast.

If I had to rank impact
Top 5, in order:

Shareable sloth profile pages

Time-limited social boosts

Class-based leaderboards

Weekly hype events

Premium analytics layer

Next step options:

Design sloth profile page layout

Define class thresholds

Sketch revenue tiers

Write the public “why this exists” narrative

Map SEO page structure

Pick one and we build it properly.

You said:
I like the sloth Classes, we would have 3 tiers, we would split classes into 1/3 based on current delgator distributions to ensure classes are of similar size
ChatGPT said:
Good. That’s the right instinct and it’s mathematically clean.
Dynamic classes based on current delegator distribution, not fixed thresholds, solves 90% of fairness and engagement problems.

Here’s how to lock this in properly.

Core rule (keep this simple and visible)
Classes are percentile-based, not stake-based.

At each snapshot, delegators are split into three equal groups by effective delegation score.

Top 33% → Canopy Sloths

Middle 33% → Grove Sloths

Bottom 33% → Sprout Sloths

No hard Coreum numbers. No fixed cutoffs.

This guarantees:

Similar class sizes

Movement between classes

Ongoing motivation

What metric determines class placement
Do not use raw delegation.

Use Effective Delegation Score, which already includes:

delegation (capped)

restake status

undelegation penalties

Class placement is based on behavior-adjusted stake, not wallet size alone.

That’s the fairness anchor.

Snapshot timing
Do this daily, same time as scoring snapshot.

Important rule:

Class changes apply next day, not instantly

Prevents whiplash

Makes movement feel earned

You can visually show:

“You’re 412 points away from moving into Canopy”

That’s engagement gold.

Rewards per class
You do not split the total prize pool equally across classes.

Recommended:

40% to Canopy

35% to Grove

25% to Sprout

Why:

Higher class still matters

Lower classes still feel winnable

No one is shut out

Within each class, distribute proportionally by race score.

How this changes behavior (this is important)
Small wallets fight in Sprout instead of quitting

Mid wallets push to break into Canopy

Whales still compete, but among peers

Social posts become class-based bragging, not raw rank flexing

You’ll see posts like:

“Moved from Grove to Canopy today 🦥🌳”

That’s exactly what you want.

Visual UX suggestions
Each class should feel distinct.

Sprout: playful, early growth

Grove: competitive, momentum

Canopy: prestige, calm dominance

Even color them differently.

Edge cases to define now
You should lock these rules early.

New delegators: start in Sprout

Ties at boundary: deterministic tie-breaker (wallet hash or join date)

If total delegators < 3: disable classes

If someone undelegates: class freeze or forced drop next day

Write this down. Don’t improvise later.

Why this is strong for SEO and social
“How do sloth classes work?” becomes search content

Class movement screenshots are shareable

No one feels invisible

This is game design done right, not gimmicks.

Next logical steps
Pick one and we go deep:

Define exact class reward splits

Write public class rules (plain English)

Design class movement UI

Stress-test manipulation scenarios

Tie classes to social boosts (carefully)

Your call.

You said:
thinking baby sloths, teen sloths and adults, but we can play with the Class names
ChatGPT said:
That naming direction is strong.
Age-based progression is intuitive, emotional, and extremely shareable. It also maps cleanly to growth, commitment, and maturity without sounding “rich vs poor”.

Let’s lock the concept, then I’ll give you name options and rules that support the story.

Core class concept (this works)
Classes represent sloth maturity, not wealth.

You grow into higher classes

You can regress if behavior slips

Everyone understands it instantly

That’s perfect for onboarding and social sharing.

Recommended class structure (top to bottom)
🦥 Baby Sloths
Entry stage.

Narrative:

Just arrived

Learning to hang

High potential

Positioning:

New delegators

Smaller or inconsistent delegations

Early race learning phase

Social flex:

“My baby sloth just woke up 🍼🦥”

🌿 Teen Sloths
Growth and momentum.

Narrative:

Building habits

Competing seriously

Visible progress

Positioning:

Consistent delegators

Restaking behavior

Pushing upward

Social flex:

“Teen sloth era unlocked 🌿🦥”

🌳 Adult Sloths
Mature, stable, elite.

Narrative:

Calm dominance

Long-term holders

Quiet confidence

Positioning:

Top third of effective scores

Long restake streaks

Reliable delegators

Social flex:

“Adult sloth energy 🌳🦥”

This feels earned, not bought.

Alternative naming sets (same structure)
Option A: Cute but serious
Baby Sloths

Growing Sloths

Elder Sloths

Option B: Nature-forward
Nest Sloths

Canopy Sloths

Apex Sloths

Option C: Coreezy brand style
Snoozers

Climbers

Anchors

Option D: Hybrid (my top pick)
Baby Sloths

Teen Sloths

Adult Sloths

It’s the most intuitive and meme-ready.

How class transitions should work (important)
To avoid chaos:

Classes recalculated daily

Changes apply next day

Movement based on percentile ranking, not raw numbers

You can show:

“You’re 1.8% away from Adult Sloth 🦥”

That drives repeat visits.

Visual and UX ideas
Baby: lighter colors, playful animation

Teen: faster movement, bolder UI

Adult: calm motion, premium feel

Make it obvious where someone sits.

Rewards framing (don’t screw this up)
Do not say:

“Adults get more because they’re bigger”

Say:

“Adults receive higher rewards because they demonstrate long-term commitment and stability.”

Words matter here.

My recommendation
Go with:
Baby → Teen → Adult Sloths

It’s:

universally understandable

emotionally engaging

social-media friendly

future-proof (easy to theme seasons)

Next step options
Lock reward splits per class

Write the public class explainer

Design sloth profile page per class

Create shareable class badges

Define regression rules (what knocks an Adult back to Teen)

Pick one and we build it cleanly.
